SSS GINGOOG: FUNERAL BENEFIT TRIAGE FLOW
Reference: Circular No. 2023-009

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CLAIMANT
Ask: "Who are you in relation to the deceased member?"

A. "I AM THE LEGAL SPOUSE"

Check: Do you have the Marriage Certificate? (LCR/PSA).

Check: Did you pay for the funeral expenses?

YES, I have the Receipt:

✅ ELIGIBLE. Submit OR + Marriage Cert.

YES, but I lost/don't have the Receipt:

✅ ELIGIBLE. Submit Notarized Affidavit of Payment + Marriage Cert.

NO, someone else paid:

🛑 STOP. You cannot claim reimbursement if you did not pay. The payer must file.

B. "I AM NOT THE SPOUSE" (Child, Parent, Sibling, Friend)

Proceed to STEP 2 immediately.

STEP 2: NON-SPOUSE ELIGIBILITY CHECK
Ask: "What is the civil status of the deceased?"

SCENARIO 1: DECEASED WAS SINGLE / WIDOWED

Check: Do you have the CENOMAR (if single) or Spouse’s Death Certificate (if widowed)?.

Check: Do you have the Official Receipt (OR) in YOUR NAME?

YES: ✅ ELIGIBLE.

NO (OR is in deceased's name or another person's name): 🛑 STOP. You must present proof you bore the cost.

SCENARIO 2: DECEASED WAS MARRIED (Spouse is alive)

Critical Rule: The Legal Spouse has absolute priority unless disqualified.

Ask: "Why is the Legal Spouse not filing?"

Reason A: "Spouse Waived their right."

Requirement: Duly notarized Waiver signed by the spouse in favor of claimant.

Plus: Official Receipt in Claimant's name.

✅ ELIGIBLE.

Reason B: "Spouse didn't pay" OR "Spouse cannot be located."

Requirement: Duly notarized Affidavit attested by two (2) disinterested persons stating this fact.

Plus: Official Receipt in Claimant's name.

✅ ELIGIBLE.

Reason C: "Spouse is separated/estranged but didn't sign a waiver."

🛑 STOP/WARNING. Without a Waiver or the Affidavit mentioned above, the claim will likely be denied in favor of the Legal Spouse.

STEP 3: THE "OFFICIAL RECEIPT" QUALITY CHECK
Apply to ALL Non-Spouse Claimants. Do not issue a number if this fails.

Is it an Official Receipt (OR)?

Temporary Receipts, Sales Invoices, or Quotations are often rejected. Ensure it is a valid proof of payment.

Is the Claimant's Name on the Receipt?

Non-spouse claimants CANNOT use an Affidavit of Payment in lieu of receipts. Only the Legal Spouse has that privilege.

If Receipt is in Deceased's Name: Generally accepted if claimant is a qualified beneficiary, but scrutinized strictly for non-relatives.

Summary of "Show-Stoppers" (Reject at PACD)
❌ Non-spouse claimant with NO Official Receipt (claims "I just paid cash/lost receipt"). Reject.

❌ Non-spouse claimant when a Legal Spouse exists, but NO Waiver and NO Affidavit of Separation/Non-payment. Reject.

❌ Claimant applying for Funeral Benefit > 10 years after death. Reject (Prescribed).
